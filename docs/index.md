# IBO Studio Documentation

Welcome to **IBO Studio**, a powerful visual builder for creating micro apps without writing code. Build beautiful, data-driven mobile experiences using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface and JSON-based configuration.

## What is IBO Studio?

IBO Studio is a no-code platform that empowers developers, designers, and product teams to rapidly build and deploy micro apps for mobile devices. Instead of writing thousands of lines of code, you visually compose apps using pre-built components and configure them with JSON.

## JSON Configuration

IBO Studio apps are defined using a JSON schema that includes:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "type": "screen",
  "title": "My Micro App",
  "state": {},
  "dataSources": {},
  "bottomNav": {
    "items": []
  },
  "sections": []
}
```

This config-driven approach enables:
- ✅ Version control with Git
- ✅ Code review and collaboration
- ✅ Reusable templates and patterns
- ✅ Dynamic updates without redeployment
- ✅ Cross-team alignment on UI contracts
